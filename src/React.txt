React is used to create UI

React is Component based Architecture 

Component 
- can be created in two ways 
- using function  (component created using function is called functional component)
- using class (component created using class is called Class component)


Class Component
 constrcutor() render() 

 Props properties 
 - it is used to pass datat from one component to the other 
 - functionComp to functionComp
 - FComp - ClassComp
 - ClassComp - ClassComp
 -ClassComp - FComp


 Class Component 
 Life cycle methods get called when a class comp is run 

 4 phases 
 Mounting (html getting mounted to DOM tree)
    Constructor(){}
    static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    render() //is must 
    componentDidMount()


 Updating (whenever u update ur state using this.setState ,below methods get called )
   static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state ) -
       -(depending on props u want to update state )
   shouldComponentUpdate()
      - (compares props and state and avoid re rendering by return boolean value false)
      (return true - render    , return false - do not render )
   render()
      - return the JSX (Javascript XML)
   getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()

   componentDidUpdate()
      this is the last method which gets called in updating phase .
 Unmounting
   The Below method gets called when the component is removed /unmounted from DOM .
    componentWillUnmount();
///

 Error Handling 
     static getDerivedErrorFromProps()
     componentDidCatch();
     
     HOC - higher Order Component is sued to share common code between the components 

 Functional component
 Class Component
 Props
 state
 this.setState
 LifeCycleMethods ()
 List rendering 
 tables
 refs
 Higher Order Component
 Fragment - it avoid unneccsary div elements 


 Render Props
 axios /fetch (used to make api calls)
 portals
 Memo 
 contextApi ()


//left over 
contextApi  no 
portals   rare 
Render props  no HOC

 React hooks   ()

 ReduxJs ()   ()
 (redux middleware Thunk)


Higher Order Comp 

reusable comp 
to share common code between the components


props
state
Higher Order Comp 

list rendering
